    "The data we want to scrape for our project is mainly the lyrics of the song. However, it might be useful to obtain other data about the songs, depending on what features we deem relevant to our question.\n",

    "Currently (2019-11-23), we believe we have to use unsupervised text sentiment analysis to obtain the output we want to analyze. This could change as time goes on. Also, we might add other factors to our question, such as Google Trends data, if we think its a necessary addition to our question. As an aside, it also be interesting to see what sentiments are more prevalent in different genres of music (i.e. does rap tend towards producing songs that are negative?). \n",

    "CURRENTLY: It queries Kendrick Lamar songs, reads the song title, artist and lyrics, stores it in a DataFrame and write to a .csv file. Need to extends scraper so it can query for a list of artists. Need to clean up the lyrics text to prepare it for text sentiment analysis. Decide on what features we want to include. And other stuff I can't think of right now."
